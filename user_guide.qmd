# Introduction

The Land Terrier has a relational model so it is important to add table entries in the correct order. A QGIS project has been created in the `qgis` schema to aid with managing the layers.

# Workflow

## Adding Sites

The first step is to make sure that a site is registers in the `land_admin.sites` table.

Start by adding a new record ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/refs/heads/master/images/themes/default/mActionNewTableRow.svg){width="24"} to the `sites` table.

Check the spelling of the `site_name` as this will be the the **definitive name** and must be used as throughout the Trust.

Create an alpha-numeric code to use as the `site_id`. Try to make it a three letter code to keep it as simple as possible. This will become the **unique identifier** for the site and must be used consistently across the Trust.

Click **OK** and save the layer edits ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/refs/heads/master/images/themes/default/mActionSaveEdits.svg){width="24"}.

## Adding Parcels

::: callout-warning
Inserting/updating parcel geometries requires advanced digitising techniques to maintain topologies, snap to nodes, and avoid overlaps. Any errors will result in misaligned site boundaries so this must be carried out by a GIS specialist.
:::

Begin by digitising the parcels on the `land_admin.parcels` layer ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/refs/heads/master/images/themes/default/mActionCapturePolygon.svg){width="24"}.

::: callout-note
Digitise against the INSPIRE polygons if available. Make sure they are topologically correct with no gaps or overlaps.
:::

Complete the form and remember to assign the parcel to a site (available in the drop-down).

![](assets/img/form-parcels-01.PNG){fig-align="center"}

You can also add additional information about the parcel using the **File** tab.

![](assets/img/form-parcels-02.PNG)

Notice that the **Metadata** tab and `area_ha` field are not populated yet. This happens the layer is committed to the database (see triggers).

::: callout-important
Leave the `valid to` and `valid from` fields blank. See [Modifying parcel geometries] on how to use these fields to update the parcel geometries.
:::

If you inspect a committed parcel, you will see the information has been updated automatically.

![](assets/img/form-parcels-03.PNG)

Click **OK** and save the layer edits ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/refs/heads/master/images/themes/default/mActionSaveEdits.svg){width="24"}. This will create a unique `parcel_uuid` identifier that will be referenced by the `ownership` layer and is also used for tracking the changes to the parcel geometry over time.

warning: Do not try to add tenure information yet. The parcel needs to be committed to the database first with the **Save Layer Edits** ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/refs/heads/master/images/themes/default/mActionSaveEdits.svg){width="24"}. This will generate the `parcel_uuid`.

## Adding Ownership

Although ownership and occupancy information can be added directly to the tables, it requires inputting and referencing the correct uuids. It is easier to start at the parcel level and use the in-built forms to keep the information up to date.

Open up the parcel form using the identify tool ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/refs/heads/master/images/themes/default/mActionIdentify.svg){width="24"}.

Add a new ownership entry in the **Tenure** section of the form.

![](assets/img/form-ownership-01.PNG){fig-align="center"}

::: callout-note
It is highly recommended that you start with an original owner. All land is owned by someone so there will have been an owner before the Trust acquires it. We are not concerned when the original owner acquired the land (this may not even be known) so the `ownership_date_start` should be left blank.
:::

If the Trust has acquired the land and become the owner, create a new record with the `ownership_date_start` as the date the Trust came into legal ownership. This cannot be left blank.

::: callout-important
In order for the tenure to be tracked correctly, the Wildlife Trust that the terrier is tracking must simply be entered as '***Trust***'. This is true for both ownership (landowner) and occupancy (occupant) records.
:::

![](assets/img/form-ownership-02.PNG)

You may also with to add additional information about the ownership under the **File** tab.

![](assets/img/form-ownership-03.PNG)

Make sure to click **OK** and commit the changes to generate the `ownership_uuid`.

Notice that the expression for the record on the left automatically updates to show the ending of the previous owner's tenure.

## Adding Occupancy

Occupancy works by being linked to an ownership record. This allows for the two way scenarios of Trusts owning land and leasing it out; and Trusts being the leaseholders on land they don't own.

To add an occupancy record, select the ownership record you want it to refer to.

Go to the last tab called **Occupancy**.

Fill in the information. All occupancy records must have an `occupancy_date_start`. There are some scenarios where the `occupancy_date_end` is either unknown or it is in a periodic tenancy where, as long as you keep paying, the lease carried on.

![](assets/img/form-occupancy-01.PNG)

The `renewal_type_code` and `termination_date` are used to indicate what happens once you are past the end date. Some leases will "holdover" after expiry whereas others have a legal cutoff. If you are past `occupancy_date_end` you will either enter a holdover or a squat. These leases need to be re-negotiated. Once you have agreed a new lease or have vacated the site, you should set the `termination_date`. This field stops the holdover or ends the squat.

:::callout-note
To make sure that there is a continual timeline of occupancy, the next negotiated lease should start when the previous one is terminated.

## Modifying parcel geometries {#modifying-parcel-geoms}

From time-to-time, you may find yourself in need of editing the parcel geometries such as realigning it with updated Land Registry data or if it gets split as part of a sale. It is important to maintain the lineage of the geometries.

Set the `valid_to` column to the date when the current geometry ceases to be valid.

Click **OK** and commit the changes ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/refs/heads/master/images/themes/default/mActionSaveEdits.svg){width="24"}. This will archive the current geometry and add it to the `land_admin.parcel_history` table via a trigger. Notice now that is you inspect the parcel, the `valid_from` date will be the date you just entered and the `valid_to` date will again be `NULL`.

You are now free to modify the geometry of the parcel and save (just leave the `valid_to` date as `NULL`).

::: callout-note
The `parcel_history` table can be freely edited. So if you want to construct a parcel's history manually, you can do so by using the `parcel_uuid`.
:::

## Handling model edge cases

There are some specific edge cases that need to be handled in a specif way so that the model logic is applied correctly.

Scenario:

The trust is occupying some land (leasehold/management agreement etc.) and the original landowner decides to sell but the Trust is to continue occupying.

Resolution:

-   Create a new ownership record with the date the new owner comes into possession.
-   Terminate the Trust's current lease with the same date as the new owner's possession.
-   Setup a new lease with the new owner starting with the new date.
