# Installation

The Land Terrier Database was created with the following software versions. It should work on newer versions and it *might* work on older versions...

:::{.callout_info}

``` default
PostgreSQL 16.4, compiled by Visual C++ build 1940, 64-bit
POSTGIS 3.4.2
QGIS 3.34.8-Prizren
```
:::

Download the creation sql script:


{{< downloadthis db/land_terrier.sql dname="land_terrier" label="land_terrier.sql" >}}


It's easiest to create the database using the `psql.exe`. Which can be found here:

``` default
C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin
```

The sql script will create a new database called `land_terrier` so it doesn't matter which database the script is executed in. I have used the default `postgres` database in this example:

``` cmd
psql -U postgres -d postgres -f "\db\land_terrier.sql" 
```

# Configuration

The QGIS project is configured to connect to a service called `land-terrier`. A `.pg_service.conf` service file needs to be created with the connection parameters to your PostgreSQL server and it needs to be available on the QGIS path.

For instructions, follow this [guide](https://www.opengis.ch/2024/05/28/the-postgresql-connection-service-file-and-why-we-love-it/).

Once configured, you can connect to the database like this and the QGIS project should work correctly:
