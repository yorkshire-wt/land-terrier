Some leases will “holdover” after expiry whereas others have a legal cutoff. If you are past occupancy_date_end you will either enter a holdover or a squat. These leases need to be re-negotiated.

A protected area established to conserve biodiversity, safeguard habitats, and promote ecological integrity. These sites are often designated for the preservation of native flora and fauna, offering a sanctuary for wildlife. These sites welcome visitors where they can engage in guided walks and wildlife observation, all while fostering a deeper appreciation for our natural ecosystems.\n\n\nEX\nExplorer Site\nA site designated for encouraging active engagement and exploration of natural landscapes. Explorer Sites serve as gateways for individuals to discover and learn about nature, promoting conservation awareness through hands-on experiences. These sites will usually have a visitor centre or other similar visitor enagement facilities. They may also be called ‘gateway’ sites.\n\n\nWLD\nWild\nThis category encompasses areas that are largely untouched by human activity. These sites promote minimal human interference, allowing nature to thrive without significant management. Wild areas are essential for preserving biodiversity and providing habitat for various species. There may be little to no visitor infrastructure and no ongoing mangement.\n\n\nARC\nArc Site\nThis is a conservation area specifically designed to serve as a refuge for vulnerable species and a hub for ecological restoration efforts. These sites may be strategically selected to connect fragmented habitats and enhance species movement across landscapes. The Arc approach emphasizes resilience and adaptability, focusing on both the preservation of existing biodiversity and the restoration of degraded habitats. the sensitivity of these sites often mean they will not be open to the public.\n\n\nDON\nDonor site\nA conservation area where biodiversity is actively cultivated and managed to provide resources for other conservation initiatives. These sites often focus on sustainable practices that promote the growth of native plants and animals, serving as a source for rewilding efforts and restoration projects elsewhere. Donor Sites contribute to regional biodiversity by supplying seeds, cuttings, or animal populations to help re-establish ecological balance in degraded areas.\n\n\nFRM\nFarm\nIn the context of nature conservation this is an active agricultural site that integrates sustainable practices with biodiversity conservation. They prioritise environemntally methods, such as organic farming, permaculture, and agroecology, to enhance soil health and support wildlife habitats. These sites often contribute to local ecosystems while providing food and resources for surrounding communities. Educational programs often highlight the connection between agriculture and conservation. This is not a category for old farms that may now be undergoing rewilding with no active farming taking place.\n\n\nLM\nLivestock Management\nThese sites focus on sustainable practices for raising animals while minimizing environmental impact. They are not fully operational farms but may be grassland sites where grazing stock are kept between rotations onto other sites. Generally speaking they may not be open to the public as there is little to no ecological interest and they are operational sites where visitors may be at risk.\n\n\nAD\nAdministrative\nThese sites relate to administrative functions of the organisation.

The leaseholder does not own the land; ownership remains with the freeholder (landlord). Leaseholders typically pay rent to the freeholder and may be responsible for maintenance and other costs. At the end of the lease term, ownership and possession of the property revert to the freeholder.\n\n\nMA\nManagement Agreement\nA Management Agreement is a legal contract between a property owner and a management company or individual responsible for overseeing the operation and maintenance of the property. This agreement outlines the responsibilities of the manager, including property upkeep, financial management, tenant relations, and compliance with regulations. It typically specifies the duration of the agreement, fees, and performance expectations, allowing property owners to ensure their assets are effectively managed without directly handling day-to-day operations.\n\n\nLI\nLicence\nA Licence is a legal agreement that permits an individual or entity to use a property owned by another party for a specific purpose, without transferring any ownership rights. Unlike a lease, a licence is usually more flexible and can be granted for a short term or for a specific activity (e.g., holding an event, accessing land for recreation). Licences are generally revocable and do not create an interest in the property, meaning the licensor retains control and can terminate the agreement as stipulated.\n\n\nFBT\nFarm Business Tenancy\nA Farm Business Tenancy (FBT) is a specific type of agricultural tenancy in the UK that allows a tenant to farm land for a defined period while adhering to the terms of the tenancy agreement. FBTs typically grant tenants the right to cultivate crops, keep livestock, and engage in agricultural activities. They are governed by specific legislation, providing tenants with certain protections, such as security of tenure and the ability to claim compensation for improvements made to the property. This arrangement supports sustainable farming practices while enabling landowners to retain ownership of their land.\n\n\nU\nUnknown occupation\nUnknown tenure types are where the land is being actively managed but there is no agreement in place or no documentation can be found to establish the type of tenure that is in place. These parcels need to be resolved as a priority and so it is very useful to flag instances where this occurs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrenewal_type_code\nRenewal Type\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nHOLD\nHoldover\nTenancy remains after the expiration of the lease so long as the tenant continues payments to the landlord.\n\n\nOUT_1954\nContracted out of Landlord and Tanants Act 1954\nExcluded from the provisions of sections 24 to 28 of the Landlord and Tenants Act 1954. If this is the case then then there is no holding over of the lease after the expiry and a new lease must be negotiated.\n\n\nPERIODIC\nPeriodic\nTenancies that do not have an end date specified.\n\n\nNONE\nNone\nMarks that lease terminates at the end of the term. This is used where a contract specifically states the contract will end ona specific date and is also used for archiving tenancies that have expired."
